Reflow Oven Controller
====================

Based on Reflow Controller from https://github.com/0xPIT/reflowOvenController

Brutally hacked around:

Use a MAX6675 thermocouple interface

Use a zero crossing SSR

Use an Arduino UNO

Use an Arduino breadboard shield

Add a 5V buzzer

Support ramped temperatures for all phases

Log temperature/time to serial in CSV format


Works with a 900W Toaster Oven (top/bottom elements, no fan)

Open oven door to get rapid cooling
